I have decided to rewrite the neural network module for organization purposes. I am also going to properly implament CNN functions into this version as well as add compatibility with multiple gradient and layer functions. I will be also adding a new model object as well as different layer type objects. currently I have gotten image pslit and such working in the new version and have began thinking up a new way of organizing all of the new function types. I'm thinking of making a model object which you then add layer objects to which would allow me to give each layer object it's own layer execution method as well as a gradient method to calculate their gradient, this should also allow me to store esential variables such as weights, the activation function, and I'm still thinking about it but I might also add the ability to store custom args such as velocity and alowing for more clean and organized code in the regard.
